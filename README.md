# Github Bulletin

You are working in an organization, contributing everyday in repositories.What happens when any new issue is added and assigned to you? generally you get a mail(which generally gets lost in the pool of other more important mails),And that way you lose track of the issues assigned to you until you log into your github account and check for yourself. Github Bulletin is a simple application which you can integrate with your slack and that will notify you in your slack channel with issues that got assigned to you.
